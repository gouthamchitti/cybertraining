# Trainer Photos

This folder is for storing trainer profile photos that will be used throughout the application.

## Guidelines for Photos:

1. **File Format**: Please use JPG, PNG, or WebP formats for best compatibility.
2. **Dimensions**: Ideally, upload square photos (1:1 aspect ratio) with dimensions of at least 500x500 pixels.
3. **File Size**: Keep file sizes under 500KB for optimal performance.
4. **Naming Convention**: Use lowercase names with hyphens for spaces (e.g., `goutham-kumar.jpg`).

## How to Add Photos:

1. Simply add your photo files directly to this folder.
2. Once added, the photos can be referenced in the application using the path: `/images/trainers/your-file-name.jpg`.

## Current Photos Needed:

- Goutham Kumar's profile photo (to be used in the hero section and as favicon)
